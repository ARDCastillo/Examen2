    My name is Ren√°n Castillo and apart from being an Industrial Engineering student, I am a professional Call of Duty: Warzone video game player who has earned more than $1,000,000 pesos from this as a hobby and being the only Mexican to qualify for the 3 world championships. It has been realized.
